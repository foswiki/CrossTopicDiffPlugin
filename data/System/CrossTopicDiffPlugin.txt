%TOC%

---++ Comparing topics

%<nop>COMPARETOPICS{OtherTopic}% compares the current topic with OtherTopic in the same web.

%<nop>COMPARETOPICS{web="Able"}% compares the current topic with the same topic in the Able web.

%<nop>COMPARETOPICS{web1="Able" web2="Baker"}% compares the current topic in the Able web with the same topic in the Baker web.

%<nop>COMPARETOPICS{web1="Able" web2="Baker" comparetopic="ThatTopic"}% compares ThatTopic in the Able web with ThatTopic in the Baker web.

%<nop>COMPARETOPICS{comparetopic1="ThatTopic" comparetopic2="OtherTopic"}% compares ThatTopic in the current web with OtherTopic in the same web.

%<nop>COMPARETOPICS{web="Able" comparetopic1="ThatTopic" comparetopic2="OtherTopic"}% compares ThatTopic in the Able web with OtherTopic in the Able web.

%<nop>COMPARETOPICS{web1="Able" web2="Baker" comparetopic1="ThatTopic" comparetopic2="OtherTopic"}% compares ThatTopic in the Able web with OtherTopic in the Baker web.

%<nop>COMPARETOPICS{web1="Able" web2="Baker" comparetopic1="ThatTopic" comparetopic2="OtherTopic" rev1="3" rev2="4"}% compares revision 3 of ThatTopic in the Able web with revision 4 of OtherTopic in the Baker web.

---++ Comparing webs

%<nop>COMPAREWEBS{Otherweb}% compares the current web with the Otherweb web.

%<nop>COMPAREWEBS{web1="Able" web2="Baker"}% compares the Able web with Baker web.

%<nop>COMPAREWEBS{...}% lists all of the topics in each web in a table, in alphabetic order.
The table shows which topics are only in one web, and which are in both.
For the topics that are in one web, there is a link to copy the topic to the other web.
For topics that are in both webs, the table shows whether they are the same, and provides a link to compare the two topics.

The compare-topics link loads the same page, but replaces the web-comparison with a comparison of the topics from the different web,
and includes a link to return to the web-comparison.

The Plugin uses javascript and a REST handler to determine if the topics in both webs are the same.
This can take some time to complete.
